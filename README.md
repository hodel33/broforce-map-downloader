# Broforce Map Downloader

## üìã Overview

The **Broforce Map Downloader** is perfect for those of you who've bought Broforce from a platform other than Steam or simply wish to play custom maps offline.<br> 
I designed this Python application to automate the process of downloading and organizing user-created maps based on specified filters such as gameplay type, difficulty level, time period and rating.

### üåü Features

- **Ready to Run**: Includes a batch file and executable for simple setup, ideal for users without Python installed.
- **Automated Map URL Fetching**: Fetches map URLs from Steam based on specified gameplay types, difficulty levels and time periods.
- **Map Downloading**: Downloads maps from the Steam Workshop.
- **Folder Organization**: Organizes downloaded maps into directories based on their rating.
- **File Organization**: Each file is named with the gameplay type, difficulty and star rating for easy identification of map characteristics.
- **Configurable Settings**: Customizable settings through a configuration file (`config.ini`).
- **Error Handling**: Robust error-handling mechanisms including retries and exponential backoff for HTTP requests.

<br>

### Download Maps

- **Fetching Map URLs**: The application searches for map URLs from Steam using specified gameplay types, difficulty levels and time periods. It intelligently skips maps that have already been downloaded.

<br>

<br>

- **Downloading Maps**: Once the map URLs are collected, the application downloads the maps trough [Steam Workshop Download](http://steamworkshop.download) and stores them in the 'maps' directory on your local machine.

<br>

- **Organizing Maps**: After all maps have been downloaded, they are automatically sorted into subdirectories for easier access, organized based on their star rating. Additionally, each map file is systematically named to reflect its gameplay type, difficulty and star rating, allowing for quick identification of the map's characteristics.

maps_per_page = 18         # Number of items per page (options: 9, 18, 30): Determines how many maps are listed on each page to be processed.
time_period = -1           # Time period in days: Filters maps based on their upload time (-1 for all time, other options: 1, 7, 90, 180, 365).
gameplay_types = 1235      # Gameplay types to include (mapping below): Specifies the types of gameplay for the maps to be fetched.
